* Hi, I'm still working on this test project and it doesn't have statistics screen yet.

* I used here :
    - MVC architecture
    - UIKit 
    - StoryBoard
    - Autolayout
    - UserNotifications
    - URLSession
    - CAShapeLayer

* This app fetch random fact from the internet when you run it. 
* You will recive notifications to remind you to drink some water. And you can add water to your tracker with notification actions
* You can also add water by tapping "add" button and choosing amount.  
* As well it has adaptive interface so you can run it and rotate on any iPhone without missing UI elements 
* You can enable notifications in settings and choose the best way for you to recieve it.
